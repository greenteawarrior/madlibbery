# Teach me how to git!

control-alt-T (open a new terminal window)

$ cd to the local directory you want your madlibbery stuff to be

$ git clone http://...the URL of madlibbery

$ ls  
$ cd madlibbery ##see, now you're in the git folder :D

$ sublime-text .madlibbery 
	#for me, this opens the madlibbery folder in sublime. not sure what happens for gedit

now, change something in the file (i.e. add your github handle to the member list)

$ git status #see what's the current state of your git

# Stage the file:
	$ git add filename.extension

	OR 

	$ git add . <-- added everything in the folder
	gitignore comes into play here if needed (don't worry about it yet)


$ git status #see, now it says "Stages to be committed"


# Now, commit the file
$ git commit 
	you'll go into nano
	type thingy then escape nano
	then control x, y, enter (see bottom of screen)

OR easier:
$ git -m "comment string"

$ git push origin master 
#enter information (github username and password) as directed

congrats! achievement unlocked, madlibbery git. :D
