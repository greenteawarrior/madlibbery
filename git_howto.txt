# Teach me how to git!

# (ignore if you're just trying to edit files) Initial git setup, when Emily made the repo on github:

$ control-alt-T (open a new terminal window)

$ cd to the local directory you want your madlibbery stuff to be

$ git clone http://...the URL of madlibbery in the git button

# If you're a collaborator (i.e. Nicole and Maura), then you're part of the shared repository. :)

# Modify a file/the files in the directory
	$ ls  
	$ cd madlibbery ##see, now you're in the git folder :D

	$ sublime-text .madlibbery 
		#for me, this opens the madlibbery folder in sublime. not sure what happens for gedit

	now, change something in the file (i.e. add your github handle to the member list)

	$ git status #see what's the current state of your git

# Stage the file:
	$ git add filename.extension

	OR 

	$ git add . <-- added everything in the folder
	gitignore comes into play here if needed (don't worry about it yet)


$ git status #see, now it says "Stages to be committed"


# Now, commit the file
	$ git commit 
		you'll go into nano
		type thingy then escape nano
		then control x, y, enter (see bottom of screen)

	OR easier:
	$ git commit -m "comment string"

	$ git push origin master 
	#enter information (github username and password) as directed

# Congrats! achievement unlocked, madlibbery git. :D
